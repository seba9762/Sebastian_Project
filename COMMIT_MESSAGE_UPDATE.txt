fix: synchronize sql/user_analytics_functions.sql with corrected migration

## Issue Resolved

Fixed deployment error: "column ls.vocabulary_id does not exist"

## Root Cause

The sql/user_analytics_functions.sql file contained old column names 
(vocabulary_id, mistake_date) while the database schema had been updated
to use new column names (word_id, created_at).

## Changes Made

1. **Updated sql/user_analytics_functions.sql**
   - Replaced with corrected version from migration file
   - Now uses word_id instead of vocabulary_id (20 occurrences)
   - Now uses created_at instead of mistake_date (11 occurrences)
   - File increased from 634 to 755 lines (includes comprehensive docs)

2. **Added Deployment Documentation**
   - DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Clear deployment steps
   - FIX_SUMMARY.md - Explanation of the fix
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
   - UPDATE_SUMMARY.md - Summary of this update

3. **Updated sql/README.md**
   - Clarified that both SQL files now work
   - Updated installation instructions
   - Removed confusing "old column names" warning

## Current State

✅ All SQL files synchronized and correct:
- supabase/migrations/20251101095455_fix_analytics_functions.sql
- sql/user_analytics_functions.sql

Both files now use correct column names matching the database schema.

## Deployment

Either file can now be used to deploy:

```bash
# Option 1: Migration file (recommended)
psql -h HOST -U USER -d DB -f supabase/migrations/20251101095455_fix_analytics_functions.sql

# Option 2: SQL file (also works)
psql -h HOST -U USER -d DB -f sql/user_analytics_functions.sql
```

## Verification

```bash
# Test deployment
psql -h HOST -U USER -d DB -c "SELECT * FROM get_dashboard_stats();"
```

Expected: No errors, function returns results

## Files Modified

- M sql/user_analytics_functions.sql (634→755 lines, +121)
- M sql/README.md (+26 lines)
- A DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (+124 lines)
